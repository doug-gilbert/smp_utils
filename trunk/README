This is a package of utilities. Each utility sends a Serial Attached
SCSI (SAS) Serial Management Protocol (SMP) request to a SMP target.
If the request fails then the error is decoded. If the request succeeds
then the response is either decoded, printed out in hexadecimal or
output in binary. This package supports multiple interfaces since
SMP passthroughs are not mature. This package supports the linux
2.4 and 2.6 series and should be easy to port to other operating
systems.

See COVERAGE file for more information about the coverage of various
SMP functions.

Each utility in the smp_utils package has a corresponding man page.
Additionally there is a 'smp_utils' man page that contains common
information, including options used by most or all utilities plus
the various exit status values.

There are examples of setting up and disabling zoning in the examples
directory.

In SAS-2.1 the lower levels were put into a document of that name
while the higher levels were put in a new document called the
SAS Protocol Layer (SPL).

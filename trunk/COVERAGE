                        Function coverage
                        =================
The following table lists SAS Management Protocol (SMP) functions
in alphabetical order in the left column. The second column is the
standard or draft that the function first appeared in or was extended.
The final column is the utility in the smp_utils package that invokes
that function on a given SMP target. Notice that many of the newly
introduced functions have no corresponding utility.

The sas-r05.pdf draft is taken to represent the original SAS standard
(ANSI INCITS 376-2003). The sas1r10.pdf draft is taken to represent the
SAS-1.1 standard (ANSI INCITS 417-2006). The most recent draft of SAS-2
is sas2r05a.pdf .

At this time all SMP functions introduced in the original standard
and SAS-1.1 have corresponding smp_utils utilities. Currently
smp_discover_list is the only utility corresponding to a newly
introduced function in SAS-2.

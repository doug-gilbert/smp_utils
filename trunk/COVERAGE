                        Function coverage
                        =================
The following table lists SAS Management Protocol (SMP) functions
in alphabetical order in the left column. The second column is the
standard or draft that the function first appeared in or was extended.
The final column is the utility in the smp_utils package that invokes
that function on a given SMP target. Notice that many of the newly
introduced functions have no corresponding utility.

*  in sas2r16 the non-ENHANCED versions are marked as obsolete but the
   ENHANCED version are not yet defined in the most recent SFF-8485
   (rev 0.7). In SAS-2.1 (spl-r07) and SAS-3 (spl2r02) these 4 functions
   are not defined (their function codes are "restricted").

There are 27 SMP functions defined in sas2r16.pdf plus 2 (or 4 since
the latter 2 replace the former 2) defined in SFF-8485.
smp_utils currently implements 28 functions (including 2 that are defined
in SFF-8485).

The sas-r05.pdf draft is taken to represent the original SAS standard
(ANSI INCITS 376-2003). The sas1r10.pdf draft is taken to represent the
SAS-1.1 standard (ANSI INCITS 417-2006). The sas2r16.pdf draft is taken
to represent the SAS-2 standard (ANSI INCITS 457-2010).

Now there is a SAS-2.1 standard at the draft stage and it has been
split into 2 documents. The document containing the SMP functions
is called the SAS Protocol Layer (SPL). So far only a small number
of changes have been made to the SMP functions in the SPL draft.
Work is ongoing on a SAS-3 standard in which a phy can run up to
12 Gbps. The document containing the SMP functions corresponding
to SAS-3 is called SPL-2 and the first draft was recently
placed on the t10 ftp site.

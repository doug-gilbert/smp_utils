                        Function coverage
                        =================
The following table lists SAS Management Protocol (SMP) functions
in alphabetical order in the left column. The second column is the
standard or draft that the function first appeared in or was extended.
The final column is the utility in the smp_utils package that invokes
that function on a given SMP target. Notice that many of the newly
introduced functions have no corresponding utility.

There are 28 SMP functions defined in sas2r12.pdf (plus 2 in SFF-8485)
of which smp_utils currently implements 14.

The sas-r05.pdf draft is taken to represent the original SAS standard
(ANSI INCITS 376-2003). The sas1r10.pdf draft is taken to represent the
SAS-1.1 standard (ANSI INCITS 417-2006). The most recent draft of SAS-2
is sas2r12.pdf .

At this time all SMP functions introduced in the original standard
and SAS-1.1 have corresponding smp_utils utilities. Currently
smp_discover_list and smp_rep_exp_route_tbl are the only utilities
corresponding to a newly introduced function in SAS-2.

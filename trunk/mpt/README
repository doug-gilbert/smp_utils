This interface uses a device node used by various MPT Fusion
drivers. It is called '/dev/mptctl' and it is a char device.
Currently a special module needs to loaded called 'mptctl'.
This can be loaded with 'modprobe mptctl'. If there are multiple
MPT Fusion HBAs on one computer then the following construction:
'/dev/mptctl,<n>' can be used for the <smp_device> argument.
LSI Logic call the <n> a "ioc" number. If not given it defaults
to 0 .

There is a pass through ioctl defined for the /dev/mptctl
device which this library uses. Since '/dev/mptctl,<n>' only
decsribes a (SMP) host, the SAS address of the target device
must be given  (i.e. therefore the '--sa=<sas_addr>' option
must be given.

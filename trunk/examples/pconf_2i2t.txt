# Assume phy id 0 is attached to initiator (HBA) doing zoning and phy control
# Assume phy id 1 is attached to another initiator (HBA)
# Assume phy id 2 is attached to a target (SAS or SATA disk)
# Assume phy id 3 is attached to a target (SAS or SATA disk)
#
# N.B. All values are hex. On each line first byte is phy_id, last byte is
# zone group. All phys that make up a wide port need to be set to the same
# zone group.
0,0,0,8
1,0,0,9
2,0,0,10	# so the zone group is 16 (10h)
3,0,0,11

# To make the disks connected to phy_ids 2 and 3 visible to both initiators,
# place them in ZG 24 (18h).

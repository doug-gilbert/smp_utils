# Example file invoked like this:
#   smp_conf_zone_phy_info --pconf=<this_filename> <smp_dev>
#
# Assume phy ids 0, 1, 2 and 3 are attached to initiator (HBA) doing
# zoning and phy control
# Assume phy ids 20, 21, 22 and 23 are attached to another initiator (HBA)
# Assume phy id 5 is attached to a target (SAS or SATA disk)
# Assume phy id 7 is attached to a target (SAS or SATA disk)
#
# N.B. All values are HEX. On each line first byte is phy_id, last byte is
# zone group. All phys that make up a wide port need to be set to the same
# zone group.
0,0,0,8         # so phy_id 0 is set to zone group 8
1,0,0,8
2,0,0,8
3,0,0,8
14,0,0,9        # so phy_id is 20 (14h)
15,0,0,9
16,0,0,9
17,0,0,9
5,0,0,10        # so this is zone group 16 (10h)
7,0,0,11

# To make the disks connected to phy_ids 5 and 7 visible to both initiators,
# place them in ZG 24 (18h).

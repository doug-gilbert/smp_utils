This directory contains scripts and associated files to show how
SAS-2 zoning might be set up and disabled using the utilities
in the main directory.

Scripts:
    zoning_ex.sh:       configure zoning
    dis_zoning_ex.sh:   disable zoning


The zoning_ex.sh script will override any zoning configuration in
place prior to its invocation. The zoning_ex.sh script does not save
any of its new settings to non-volatile storage on the expander. So
if experimentation fails, resetting or power cycling the expander
will restore the previous settings **.

The zoning_ex.sh script is relatively generic with the tailoring to
a set of zone permissions and mapping of expander phys to zone groups
being done either by two files in this directory:
    permf_8i9t.txt
    pconf_2i2t.txt
or, alternatively the permission file and the phy info file can be given
on the script command line (following the expander device node name).
Note that if pconf_2i2t.txt is used then phy ids will most likely need
to be changed to match which cable is connected to which expander
phy. [Suggestion: examine the output of smp_discover closely to determine
which expander phys are connected to what.]

The zone permissions can be read back from the expander with the REPORT
ZONE PERMISSION TABLE function (smp_rep_zone_perm_tbl utility). After
zoning has been set up the smp_rep_zone_perm_tbl is called twice, the
second time with the --nocomma option, and the output is in these files:
    rep_permf_8i9t.txt
    rep_nocom_permf_8i9t.txt
Note that the input permission file (i.e. permf_8i9t.txt) was formatted
as if there are only 128 zone groups but the output shows there are
actually 256 zone groups. The expander obviously can cope with this. Also
the smp_rep_zone_perm_tbl utility was called without --multiple so less
than 256 source zone groups are returned. This does not matter since
no zone group above 30 is being used, so all the remaining rows have their
default settings.

** Just in case the zone permission table or the zone phy information
   is saved, these default files are provided:
      def_permf.txt
      def_pconf.txt

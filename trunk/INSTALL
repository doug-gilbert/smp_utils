To build and install using the tarball, extract the files from
the tarball, change directory to the top level within the
extracted tree, and then:
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

The last command will most likely require root privileges and will
place the binaries in the /usr/local/bin directory. Since the utilities
need root (superuser) permissions some distrubutions prefer to place the
binaries in the /usr/sbin directory. To do that and place the man pages
in their normal (Linux) location the ./configure line could be expanded
to:
  # ../configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/sbin

If the configure.ac file in the main directory or any of the Makefile.am
files are changed then this should be run prior to ./configure :
  # ./autogen.sh

Also if the ./configure script fails (or the following make) then running
the ./autogen.sh may help.

To clean up after a build use the following command:
  # make distclean


The build depends on libtool since a shared library is produced. A static
library is also produced. By default the binaries (i.e. the utilities
in this package) will depend on that shared library. The binaries can
be linked instead with the static library with this invocation:
  # ./configure --disable-shared

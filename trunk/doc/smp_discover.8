.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends one or more SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) DISCOVER function
requests to an SMP target and decodes or outputs the responses. The SMP target
is identified by the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fISAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on
the interface, the \fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR.
The mpt interface uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP
initiator) and needs the additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs
if there are multiple present.
.PP
If the \fI\-\-phy=ID\fR option is not given then \fI\-\-summary\fR is
assumed. When \fI\-\-summary\fR is given or assumed, this utility shows
the disposition of each active expander phy in table form. One row is shown
for each phy and is described in the SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT section
below. For this purpose disabled expander phys and those with errors are
considered "active" and can be suppressed from the output by adding the
\fI\-\-brief\fR option.
.PP
Rather than supply options and \fISMP_DEVICE[,N]\fR on every invocation
some can be supplied via environment variables. See the section on
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-adn\fR
causes the "attached device name" field to be output when the
\fI\-\-multiple\fR or \fI\-\-summary\fR option is also given. See the section
below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT. Note the "attached device name" field
was added is SAS\-2.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-brief\fR
reduce the decoded response output. If used twice will exit if there is no
attached device (after outputting that). When used with \fI\-\-multiple\fR,
unattached phys are not listed; when used twice, trims attached phys
output.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cap\fR
decode and print phy capabilities bits fields (see SNW-3 in draft). Each
expander phy has three of these fields: programmed, current and attached.
By default these fields are only printed out in hex, or not at all if
the \fI\-\-brief\fR option is given or implied. Of the three the attached
phy capability field is probably the most interesting. If the
\fI\-\-verbose\fR option is given, then the various "G" identifiers are
expanded (e.g. instead of "G4:" it prints "G4 (12 Gbps):").
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dsn\fR
outputs the device slot number at the end of each summary line. In summary
mode one line is output per expander phy. It is output in the
form "dsn=<val>" where <val> is decimal in the range from 0 to 254 inclusive.
It is not output if it is not available or has the value 255. An expander
typically contains a SES device which yields device slot numbers in its
Additional Element Status diagnostic page.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR
sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP Discover request. Expander
phys hidden by zoning will appear as "phy vacant" unless this option
is given.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
list attributes in "name=value" form, one entry per line.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiple\fR
loops over multiple phys within SMP target (typically an expander) and
does a DISCOVER request and outputs a one line summary. Phy 0 is queried
first, then phy 1, continuing until an error occurs. The starting phy
and the number of phys "discovered" can be controlled by \fI\-\-phy=ID\fR
and \fI\-\-num=NUM\fR. If \fI\-\-brief\fR is given then there is no output
for phys that indicate there is no attached device. When this option is
used twice then multi\-line output is produced for each phy. See the
section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-my\fR
outputs my (this expander's) SAS address in hex (prefixed by "0x"). This
is obtained from the DISCOVER response of phy id 0 (unless \fI\-\-phy=ID\fR
is given). The expander's SAS address is typically available even if a phy
is not connected, "vacant" or disabled. This option overrides most other
options (e.g. overrides \fI\-\-multiple\fR and \fI\-\-summary\fR options).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-num\fR=\fINUM\fR
number of phys to fetch, starting at \fI\-\-phy=ID\fR when the
\fI\-\-multiple\fR option is given. The default value is 0 which is
interpreted as "the rest" (i.e. until a "phy does not exist" function
result is received). This option is ignored in the absence of the
\fI\-\-multiple\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-phy\fR=\fIID\fR
phy identifier. \fIID\fR is a value between 0 and 254. If this option is
not given then the \fI\-\-summary\fR option is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR has the
target's SAS address within it. The \fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most
SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-summary\fR
output a multi line summary, with one line per active phy. Checks all
phys (or less is \fI\-\-num=NUM\fR is given), starting at phy 0 (unless
\fI\-\-phy=ID\fR is given). Equivalent to '\-\-multiple \-\-brief' ('\-mb').
See the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT. If the
\fI\-\-phy=ID\fR is not given then this option is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This option
also zeros the Request Length field in the request. This is required
for strict SAS\-1.1 compliance. However this option should not be
given in SAS\-2 and later; if it is given an abridged response may result.
.SH SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT
The \fI\-\-summary\fR option causes SMP DISCOVER responses to be compressed
to a header followed by one line per phy. To save space SAS addresses are
shown in hex without a '0x' prefix or 'h' suffix. The header line gives the
SAS address of the SMP target itself and assumes it is an expander.
.PP
Each line starts with "  phy  <n>:" where <n> is the phy identifier (and
they are origin zero). That is followed by the routing attribute represented
by a single letter which is either "D" for direct routing, "S" for
subtractive routing, "T" or "U". Both "T" and "U" imply table routing, the
difference is that if REPORT GENERAL indicates "table to table supported"
then "U" is output to indicate that phy can be part of an enclosure
.B universal
port; otherwise "T" is used. Next comes the negotiated physical link rate
which is either "disabled", "reset problem" or "spinup hold". Other states
are mapped to "attached". This includes enabled phys with nothing connected
which appear as "attached:[0000000000000000:00]".
.PP
Information shown between the brackets is for the attached device.
Phys that are connected display something
like: "attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01 " where the first number is the
attached SAS address (in hex) and the second number is the attached
device's phy identifier. If the attached device type is other
than a SAS or SATA device then one of these abbreviations is
output: "exp" (for expander), "fex" (for fanout
expander) or "res" (for unknown attached device type). If a phy is
flagged as "virtual" then the letter "V" appears next. Next are the
protocols supported by the attached device which are
shown as "i(<list>)" for initiator protocols and/or "t(<list>)" for
target protocols. The <list> is made up
of "PORT_SEL", "SSP", "STP", "SMP" and "SATA" with "+" used as a
separator. For example a SAS host adapter will most likely appear
as: "i(SSP+STP+SMP)". This completes the information about the
attached phy, hence the closing right bracket.
.PP
If appropriate, the negotiated physical link rate is shown in
gigabits per second. Here is an example of a line for expander
phy identifier 11 connected to a SATA target (or SATA "device" to use
the t13.org term):
.PP
  phy  11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00  t(SATA)]  1.5 Gbps
.PP
If the expander has zoning enabled (i.e. REPORT GENERAL response bit
for 'zoning enabled' is set) and a phy's zone group is other than zg 1
then the phy's zone group is shown (e.g. "ZG:2").
.PP
If the \fI\-\-adn\fR option is given then after the attached SAS address
and the attached device's phy identifier are output an extra field is
inserted containing the "attached device name" field. For a SAS disk this
should be its target device name (in NAA\-5 format) and for a SATA disk its
WWN (if provided, also in NAA\-5 format). Also when the \fI\-\-adn\fR option
is given the phy speed and zone group are not output in order to keep the
line length reasonable.
.PP
If the \fI\-\-dsn\fR option is given and device slot number information is
available for the current phy, then "dsn=<num>" is appended to the line.
Device slot numbers range from 0 to 254 with 255 meaning there is no
corresponding slot so it is not listed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If \fISMP_DEVICE[,N]\fR is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment
variable is checked and if present its contents are used instead.
.PP
If the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is required (i.e.
it is not implicit in \fISMP_DEVICE[,N]\fR) then the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR
environment variable is checked and if present its contents are used as the
SAS address. SAS addresses are usually given in hex indicated by a
leading '0x' or trailing 'h'.
.PP
A device slot number (dsn) is important for establishing the relationship
between an expander phy and a SES array element. Newer expanders (e.g. SAS\-3)
support dsn_s in the DISCOVER (and DISCOVER LIST) functions. These can be
shown, if available, with the \-\-dsn option to smp_discover and
smp_discover_list utilities.. To ease typing that option often, the
SMP_UTILS_DSN environment variableriable, if present, has the same effect.
.SH NOTES
In SAS\-2 and later both the DISCOVER and DISCOVER LIST functions are
available. The DISCOVER LIST function should be favoured for several
reasons: its response can hold up to 40 descriptors each describing the
state of one expander phy. The vast majority of expander chips on the market
support 36 phys or less so one DISCOVER LIST response will summarize the
states of all its phys. With the DISCOVER function only one expander phy's
state is returned in its response. Other advantages of the DISCOVER LIST
function are its "phy filter" and "descriptor type" function request fields.
.SH EXAMPLES
See "Examples" section in http://sg.danny.cz/sg/smp_utils.html
.SH CONFORMING TO
The SMP DISCOVER function was introduced in SAS\-1, with small additions
in SAS\-1.1 . There were a large number of additions in SAS\-2 . After
SAS\-2 the protocol sections of SAS were split into another document
series known as SPL. Now SPL and SPL\-2 are standards and SPL\-3 is in
the draft stage.

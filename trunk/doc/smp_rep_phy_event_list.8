.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT PHY EVENT LIST function
request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the
\fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fISAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface, the
\fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt interface
uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the
additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.
.PP
Reports zero or more phy event list descriptors. Each descriptor contains a
phy identifier, a phy event source, a phy event (i.e. a count) and a peak
value detector theshold. At least one phy event should be maintained for
each phy.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-desc\fR
precede each phy event descriptor with a line announcing its descriptor index 
number. Index numbers start at 1.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-enumerate\fR
enumerate all of the known Phy Event Source names, one per line preceded by
its value in hex. Ignores \fISMP_DEVICE\fR if it is given; most other
options are also ignored. Exits after displaying the names.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
force the report to continue after the last descriptor index has been
exceeded. The default action is too stop the report when the last descriptor
index has been exceeded.
at 1.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIIN\fR
starting phy event list descriptor index. \fIIN\fR is a value between 0 and
65535. The default is 1. If \fIIN\fR is 0 then the response should contain
no phy event list descriptors but the 'last phy event list descriptor index'
and 'phy event list descriptor length' fields in the response should be set
appropriately. The last point was clarified in SPL\-2 revision 3.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
prefix each phy event source string with its numeric identifier in hex.
Also place "phy_id=" in front of the phy identifier number.
For example: "phy_id=3: [0x1]: Invalid word count: 29"; without this option
this line would be: "3: Invalid word count: 29".
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nonz\fR
only show phy events with non\-zero counts or peak values. The default is to
show all phy events in the response.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR has the
target's SAS address within it. The \fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most
SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP target phys (e.g. on a SAS
disk). It can be obtained from the Protocol Specific Port log page with
the sg_logs utility.
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator phys (e.g. on a SAS
HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28 error information can be found in this
directory /sys/class/sas_phy/phy\-4:0 (for the phy 0 in SCSI/SAS host 4).
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys (e.g. on a SATA
disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS and the SATA device then the
sg_sat_phy_event utility can fetch the information.

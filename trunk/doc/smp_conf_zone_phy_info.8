[\fI\-\-interface=PARAMS\fR] \fI\-\-pconf=FN\fR [\fI\-\-raw\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) CONFIGURE ZONE PHY INFORMATION
function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the
\fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fI\-\-sa=SAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface,
the \fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt
interface uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and
needs the additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs if there are
multiple present.
.PP
Each zone phy configuration descriptor is 4 bytes long. The first byte
is a (expander) phy identifier. The second byte has 3 modifiable bits: bit 5
is "inside ZPSDS persistent"; bit 4 is "requested inside ZPSDS"; and bit 2
is "zone group persistent". The other bits in the second byte are reserved
and should be 0. The third byte is reserved and should be 0. The fourth byte
is the zone group.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-expected\fR=\fIEX\fR
set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.
The value \fIEX\fR is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default
value. When \fIEX\fR is greater than zero then if the value doesn't match
the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when
the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a
function result of "invalid expander change count" in the response.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pconf\fR=\fIFN\fR
\fIFN\fR is a file containing zone phy configuration descriptors in ASCII
hexadecimal; either as bytes separated by space, tab, comma or newline,
or as longer strings of hexadecimal bytes in which every 2 digits
represents a byte. Empty lines and those starting with "#" are ignored.
Since each zone phy configuration descriptor is 4 bytes long, the number
of bytes in \fIFN\fR is expected to be a multiple of 4.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs
this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The
\fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal.
To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a
trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-save\fR=\fISAV\fR
set the 'save' field in the SMP request. \fISAV\fR may take these values:
0 for updating the shadow values (default), 1 for updating the saved values,
2 for updating shadow values and if available the saved values, 3 for
updating both saved and shadow values.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
The expander phys that make up a wide port (2 or more attached to phys with
the same SAS address) must be set to the same zone phy configuration
settings (other than the phy id).
.PP
Zone phy information can be read back from an expander and placed in a file
with the smp_discover_list utility's \fI\-\-zpi=FN\fR option. The format of
that file should be suitable for this utility's \fI\-\-pconf=FN\fR option.

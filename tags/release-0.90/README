This is a package of utilities. Each utility sends a Serial Attached
SCSI (SAS) Management Protocol (SMP) request to a SMP target.
If the request fails then the error is decoded. If the request succeeds
then the response is either decoded, printed out in hexadecimal or
output in binary. This package supports multiple interfaces since
SMP passthroughs are not mature. This package supports the linux
2.4 and 2.6 series and should be easy to port to other operating
systems.

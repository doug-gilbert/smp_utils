.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
smp_utils is a package of utilities. Each utility sends a Serial Attached
SCSI (SAS) Management Protocol (SMP) request to a <smp_device> (a SMP
target). If an error occurs then the error message is sent to stderr.
If no error occurs, the response is decoded (the default), output
in ASCII hex (when '--hex' is given) or output in binary to
stdout (when '--raw' is given).
.PP
If <smp_device>[,<n>] is not given then the value in the environment
variable SMP_UTILS_DEVICE is used.
.SH INTERFACE
Currently there are multiple interfaces that allow SMP functions to
be passed through to a SMP target.
.PP
One method is to have a <smp_device> which is actually the SMP
initiator (e.g. '/dev/mptcl,0'). In this case the '--sa=<sas_addr>'
of the SMP target must be supplied.
.PP
Another method is to have a <smp_device> which represents the
SMP target. In this case no <sas_addr> needs to be given (since it
is implicit). This method may be simpler but it precludes the
discovery process.
.PP
Each utility in smp_utils attempts to work out which interface it has
been given by examining the <smp_device> file. There
are two interfaces supported currently:
.TP
.I mpt
This specifies the MPT fusion SAS passthrough which uses the /dev/mptctl
device node. If mpt drivers are loaded but /dev/mptctl is not present
then a 'modprobe mptctl' command may be needed. If there are multiple
mpt fusion controllers (HBAs) in the computer, then the user may need
to specify which one to use with the syntax: '/dev/mptcl,<n>' where <n>
is the "ioc" number. When this interface is used the '--sa=<sas_addr>'
option must be given to specify the SAS address of the SMP target.
.TP
.I tpl (ai)
This interface is currently used by one adaptec 94xx driver. The "device"
name will usually be "smp_portal" and it will be found within the sysfs
file system (typically mounted under "/sys"). The target SMP SAS address
is implicit (as is the SMP initiator). Either 'tpl' or 'ai' can be used
to specify this interface.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If the device name is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment
variable is checked and if present its contents are used as the device name.
.PP
If the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is
required (i.e. it is not implicit in the device name) then
the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR environment variable is checked and if present
its contents are used as the SAS address.
.SH PROCESS STATUS
If a utility can form the SMP request, send it to the pass through, fetch
the response and find the response is well formed and reports no errors
then the process exits with a status value of 0 . Otherwise the process
exits with a status value of 1 .
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
--help | -h
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
--hex | -H
output the response in hexadecimal.
.TP
--interface=<intf>[,force] | -I <intf>[,force]
interface specific parameters. This option is usually not needed since the
interface type is guessed by a utility based on the characteristics
of the given <smp_device> argument. If the guess doesn't work then the
interface can be specified by giving a <intf> of either 'mpt' or 'tpl'.
Sanity checks are still performed and a utility may refuse if it doesn't
agree with the given <intf>. If the user is really sure then adding
a ',force' will force the utility to assume the given interface.
.TP
--raw | -r
send the response to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
--sa=<sas_addr> | -s <sas_addr>
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the <smp_device> has the target's
SAS address within it. The <sas_addr> is in decimal but most SAS addresses
are shown in hexadecimal. The give a number in hexadecimal either prefix
it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it. If not given then the value in
the environment variable SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR is used.
.TP
--verbose | -v
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times
.TP
--version | -V
print the version string and then exit.

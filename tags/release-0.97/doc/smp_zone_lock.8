smp_zone_lock \- invoke ZONE LOCK SMP function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smp_zone_lock
[\fI\-\-expected=EX\fR] [\fI\-\-fpass=FP\fR] [\fI\-\-help\fR]
[\fI\-\-hex\fR] [\fI\-\-inactivity=TL\fR] [\fI\-\-interface=PARAMS\fR]
[\fI\-\-password=PA\fR] [\fI\-\-raw\fR] [\fI\-\-sa=SAS_ADDR\fR]
[\fI\-\-verbose\fR] [\fI\-\-version\fR] \fISMP_DEVICE[,N]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) ZONE LOCK function request to an
SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the
\fI\-\-sa=SAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface, the \fISAS_ADDR\fR may
be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt interface uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR
to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional \fI,N\fR to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-expected\fR=\fIEX\fR
set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.
The value \fIEX\fR is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default
value. When \fIEX\fR is greater than zero then if the value doesn't match
the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when
the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a
function result of "invalid expander change count" in the response.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fpass\fR=\fIFP\fR
where \fIFP\fR is the name of a file which contains the password. The
password may be in ASCII in which case it is on one line surrounded by either
single quotes are double quotes. Alternatively the password may be given in
ASCII hexadecimal; either as bytes separated by space, tab, comma or
newline, or as longer strings of hexadecimal bytes in which every 2 digits
represents a byte. Empty lines and those starting with "#" are ignored.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inactivity\fR=\fITL\fR
sets the zone lock inactivity time limit to \fITL\fR which has units of
100 milliseconds. The default value is 0 which implies no time limit.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR=\fIPA\fR
where \fIPA\fR is the zone manager password which may be up to 32 bytes
long. This option cannot be give together with the \fI\-\-fpass=FP\fR
option. The default password is 32 NULLs (zero bytes) and \fIPA\fR is
padded with NULLs to the right (to make it 32 bytes long in the request).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs
this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The
\fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal.
To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a
trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.

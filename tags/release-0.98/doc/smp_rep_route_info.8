.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION
function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the
\fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fISAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface, the
\fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt interface
uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the
additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.
.PP
There are two expander route table types: phy\-based and expander\-based.
The expander\-based route table was introduced in SAS\-2 and supersedes the
phy\-based route tables. The REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION function is associated
with a phy\-based route table. The CONFIGURE ROUTE INFORMATION function
is provided to manually set up a phy\-based route table.
.PP
Each phy in a SAS expander that has an associated routing attribute
of "table" has a router table. The number of rows (or entries) in
each router table is given by the "expander route indexes" field
in the response of the REPORT GENERAL function.
.PP
When the \fI\-\-multiple\fR option is given, the REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION
function is called multiple times. The index value increments on
each iteration, starting from \fI\-\-index=IN\fR (default 0). If
\fI\-\-num=NUM\fR is given and \fINUM\fR is greater than zero then that is
the maximum number of iterations performed. If \fI\-\-num=NUM\fR is not
given (or \fINUM\fR is zero) then iterations continue until there are 4
adjacent disabled route entries (or some error is detected).
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIIN\fR
expander route index. \fIIN\fR is a value between 0 and 65535. Default is 0.
More precisely the maximum index value is (expander_route_indexes \- 1).
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiple\fR
call the REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION function multiple times, starting at
\fI\-\-index=IN\fR, incrementing the index value on each iteration for a
maximum of \fI\-\-num=NUM\fR iterations. For each enabled route table entry,
one line is output. If \fI\-\-num=NUM\fR is not given (or \fINUM\fR is zero)
then iterations continue until 4 adjacent disabled entries are found (or
some error occurs).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-num\fR=\fINUM\fR
used with \fI\-\-multiple\fR option to specify the maximum number of
iterations.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-phy\fR=\fIID\fR
phy identifier. \fIID\fR is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR has the
target's SAS address within it. The \fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most
SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This option 
also zeros the Request Length field in the request. This is required
for strict SAS\-1.1 compliance. However this option should not be
given in SAS\-2 and later; if it is given an abridged response may result.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The SMP REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION function was introduced in SAS\-1 .
The "Expander change count" field was added in SAS\-2 .

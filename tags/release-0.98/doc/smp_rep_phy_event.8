[\fI\-\-raw\fR] [\fI\-\-sa=SAS_ADDR\fR] [\fI\-\-verbose\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT PHY EVENT function
request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the
\fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fISAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface, the
\fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt interface
uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the
additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.
.PP
Reports zero or more phy event descriptors. Each descriptor contains a phy
event source, a phy event (i.e. a count) and a peak value detector theshold.
At least one phy event should be maintained for each phy.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-desc\fR
precede each phy event descriptor with a line announcing its descriptor index
number. Index numbers start at 1.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-enumerate\fR
enumerate all of the known Phy Event Source names, one per line preceded by
its value in hex. Ignores \fISMP_DEVICE\fR if it is given; most other 
options are also ignored. Exits after displaying the names.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
prefix each phy event source string with its numeric identifier in hex.
For example: "[0x1]: Invalid word count: 23"
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-phy\fR=\fIID\fR
phy identifier. \fIID\fR is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR has the
target's SAS address within it. The \fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most
SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP target phys (e.g. on a SAS
disk). It can be obtained from the Protocol Specific Port log page with
the sg_logs utility.
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator phys (e.g. on a SAS
HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28 error information can be found in this
directory /sys/class/sas_phy/phy\-4:0 (for the phy 0 in SCSI/SAS host 4).
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys (e.g. on a SATA
disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS and the SATA device then the
sg_sat_phy_event utility can fetch the information.
.SH CONFORMING TO

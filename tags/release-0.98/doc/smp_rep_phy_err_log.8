\fISMP_DEVICE[,N]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT PHY ERROR LOG function
request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the
\fISMP_DEVICE\fR and the \fISAS_ADDR\fR. Depending on the interface, the
\fISAS_ADDR\fR may be deduced from the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR. The mpt interface
uses \fISMP_DEVICE\fR to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the
additional \fI,N\fR to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the
path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-phy\fR=\fIID\fR
phy identifier. \fIID\fR is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error
messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sa\fR=\fISAS_ADDR\fR
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the \fISMP_DEVICE\fR has the
target's SAS address within it. The \fISAS_ADDR\fR is in decimal but most
SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This option
also zeros the Request Length field in the request. This is required
for strict SAS\-1.1 compliance. However this option should not be
given in SAS\-2 and later; if it is given an abridged response may result.
.SH NOTES
Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP target phys (e.g. on a SAS
disk). It can be obtained from the Protocol Specific Port log page with
the sg_logs utility.
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator phys (e.g. on a SAS
HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28 error information can be found in this
directory /sys/class/sas_phy/phy\-4:0 (for the phy 0 in SCSI/SAS host 4).
.PP
Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys (e.g. on a SATA
disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS and the SATA device then the
sg_sat_phy_event utility can fetch the information.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The SMP REPORT PHY ERROR LOG function was introduced in SAS\-1 .
The "Expander change count" field was added in SAS\-2 .

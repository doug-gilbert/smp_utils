Build
-----
For general build information see the INSTALL file.

A "spec" file is included for building rpm packages. It is called
smp_utils.spec . To build binary and source rpms place a copy of the
gzipped tarball in the "SOURCES" directory and place a copy of
smp_utils.spec in the "SPEC" directory. These directories are found under
/usr/src/redhat on redhat/fedora distributions. Then from the "SPEC"
directory execute "rpmbuild -ba --target i386 smp_utils.spec". If all goes
well a source rpm should be found in the SRPMS directory and binary rpms
in the RPMS/i386 directory (for i386 architecture). When the smp_utils
binary rpm is installed the executables and their associated man pages
should be placed in appropriate places.

To build debian "deb" (binary) packages, first untar the tarball, then
change directory to the top level within the smp_utils source. Then:
 # chmod +x debian/rules
 # dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot
The binary deb packages will be placed in the parent directory (of
the smp_utils source directory) if all goes well. The
build_debian.sh script contains the above commands.

Device names
------------
All of the man page examples and the scripts in the examples directory
use Linux device names for accessing SAS expanders. The preferred
interface is through the bsg driver. Examples of the bsg driver's device
node names are /dev/bsg/expander-6:0 and /dev/bsg/sas_host6 .

Alternatively MPT Fusion HBAs can use the mpt*sas driver's interface
whose device node has the form "/dev/mptctl[,N]", "/dev/mpt2ctl[,N]"
or "/dev/mpt3ctl[,N]" depending on the SAS generation of the HBA.

For Adaptec/PMC SAS RAID controllers that use the Linux aacraid driver,
the bsg interface is not available. Their pass-through has device node
names of the form /dev/aac[N[,E_ID]] where "N" is the raid controller
number (typically 0) and "E_ID" is the expander identifier (typically 0).
Both "N" and "E_ID" default to 0 so on a system with one Adaptec/PMC SAS
RAID controller with one attached expander, "/dev/aac" should access it.

This is a package of command line utilities. Each utility sends a Serial
Attached SCSI (SAS) Serial Management Protocol (SMP) request to an SMP
target. If the request fails then the error is decoded. If the request
succeeds then the response is either decoded, printed out in hexadecimal
or output in binary. This package was written using the Linux 2.6 and
3 series; it has been ported to FreeBSD and Solaris.

For specific information about Linux see README.linux; for FreeBSD see
README.freebsd and for Solaris see README.solaris .

See COVERAGE file for more information about the coverage of various
SMP functions.

Each utility in the smp_utils package has a corresponding man page. These
are found in the doc directory. Additionally there is 'smp_utils' man page
that contains common information, including options used by most or all
utilities plus the various exit status values. There is also a Linux
specific 'bsg_sas_smp.txt' file that discusses the use of the bsg driver
to send SMP requests.

There are examples of setting up and disabling zoning in the examples
directory.

In SAS-2.1 the physical layer was put into a document of that name
(i.e. SAS-2.1) while the higher layers were put in a new document called
the SAS Protocol Layer (SPL).

This directory contains scripts and associated files to show how
SAS-2 zoning might be set up and disabled using the utilities
in the main directory.

Scripts:
    zoning_ex.sh:       configure zoning
    dis_zoning_ex.sh:   disable zoning


The zoning_ex.sh script will override any zoning configuration in
place prior to its invocation. The zoning_ex.sh script does not save
any of its new settings to non-volatile storage on the expander. So
if experimentation fails, resetting or power cycling the expander
will restore the previous settings.

The zoning_ex.sh script is relatively generic with the tailoring to
a set of zone permissions and mapping of expander phys to zone groups
being done either by two files in this directory:
    permf_8i9t.txt
    pconf_2i2t.txt
or, alternatively the permission file and the phy info file can be given
on the script command line (following the expander device node name).

# Example file invoked like this:
#   smp_conf_zone_perm_tbl --permf=<this_filename> --deduce <smp_dev>
#
# Assume 128 zone groups (hence 16 byte table entries); note: even
# if expander permits 256 zone groups, it still seems to accept the
# 16 byte table entries format.
# Note that the starting source zone group is set to 10 by this file.

# This zone permission descriptor file is designed to set up the
# SMP CONFIGURE ZONE PERMISSION TABLE request shown in the "Zone
# permission configuration descriptor examples" annex is various
# SAS-2 (and later) drafts. [It is Annex L in sas2r16.pdf; Annex H in
# spl-r07.pdf and spl2r03.pdf .]

# 
# The request in the Annex example turns all the zone group permission
# bits on in source zone group 10, then turns all the zone group
# permission bits off in source zone group 11 .

# N.B. Since SCSI is big endian, the lower bit positions are to the right.
# Each element below is a byte, represented in ASCII hexadecimal.
#

# Note the '--start=10' so the following descriptors start at source
# zone group 10.
# If an expander only supports 256 zone groups without expansion of the 16
# byte format, just expand the first line to have 32 bytes of ff and the
# second line to 32 bytes of 0 .
--start=10
ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff,ff
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

# Why do this? To illustrate that the descriptor not only becomes the
# source zone group row in the permission table, but its transpose
# should also be placed in the corresponding destination zone group
# column. Also invariants are preserved (e.g. ZP[1,*] and ZP[*,1] are
# always set). And the descriptors are applied in the order that appear
# (i.e. ascending source zone group numbers).

# Not all SAS-2 expanders do the transpose insertion. Users may need
# to check. Such a check could be done with:
#   smp_rep_zone_perm_tbl --bits=13 <expander_dev>
#
# Note that the t10 annex example shows the ZP array with its origin
# (i.e. ZP[0,0]) in the top left corner. However smp_rep_zone_perm_tbl's
# output will show the origin in the top right corner (due to SCSI's big
# endian internal representation). To override that, the "--bits=13" option
# presents the output like the t10 annex example (i.e. bit oriented, little
# endian).
#
# To comply with t10 rules ZP[10,11] should be zero (as should ZP[11,10]).

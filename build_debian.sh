# in some environments the '-rfakeroot' can cause a failure (e.g. when
# building as root). If so, remove that argument from the following:
echo "dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot -us -uc"
dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot -us -uc

# If the above succeeds then the ".deb" binary package is placed in the
